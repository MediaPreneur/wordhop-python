# [Wordhop](https://www.wordhop.io) For Chatbots Built in Python

###What you need to get started:
* [A Slack Account](http://www.slack.com)
* [Wordhop for Slack](https://slack.com/oauth/authorize?scope=users:read,users:read.email,commands,chat:write:bot,channels:read,channels:write,bot&client_id=23850726983.39760486257)
* [A Chatbot built in Python](https://developer.wordhop.io/botbuilders.html)

###Integrating Wordhop into your Chatbot
`run: pip install -r requirements.txt in your shell`

###Dependencies
* You'll need an API key from Wordhop and for each Chatbot a Bot Token.  You can get both of those (free) when you add [Wordhop for Slack](https://slack.com/oauth/authorize?scope=users:read,users:read.email,commands,chat:write:bot,channels:read,channels:write,bot&client_id=23850726983.39760486257) via through a conversation with the Wordhop bot. 
* If you're building a Messenger Chatbot, you'll need to setup a Facebook App, Facebook Page, get the Page Access Token from Facebook and link the Facebook App to the Facebook Page for Wordhop to work.
